Atliq Hardware Sales Insights Dashboard
Problem Statement
Atliq Hardware, a leading supplier of computer hardware and peripherals across India, is facing challenges in efficiently tracking and analyzing sales performance. Bhaven Patel, the Sales Director, relies on regional managers from North, South, and Central India for sales updates. Unfortunately, these insights are often verbal, sugar-coated, or incomplete, making it difficult for him to get an accurate picture of the companyâ€™s performance.

Currently, sales data is provided in the form of numerous Excel files containing thousands of rows, which makes it time-consuming to extract meaningful insights. As the market rapidly grows, Bhaven is looking for a more efficient way to track sales and identify opportunities or problem areas in the business.

Key Requirements:
Centralized Dashboard: Bhaven needs a real-time dashboard that consolidates sales data and provides a clear overview of the business.
Data-Driven Insights: The dashboard should allow Bhaven to easily identify trends, track regional performance, and make data-driven decisions.
Actionable Metrics: The goal is to provide insights on areas that need attention, such as regions where sales are declining, and offer data-backed recommendations for actions like launching promotions or increasing customer engagement.
Solution
We propose the development of a real-time sales insights dashboard that will provide Bhaven and the Atliq Hardware team with a centralized platform to monitor and analyze sales performance. This dashboard will offer:

Key Metrics & KPIs: The dashboard will highlight crucial metrics such as sales trends, product performance, regional breakdowns, and comparisons against sales targets.
Actionable Insights: Data will be presented in a way that highlights key trends, underperforming regions, and opportunities for improvement, enabling Bhaven to make informed decisions quickly.
Features:
Real-time Sales Data: Get an up-to-date view of sales performance across different regions.
Regional Sales Breakdown: Visualize sales performance across North, South, and Central India to easily spot which areas need attention.
